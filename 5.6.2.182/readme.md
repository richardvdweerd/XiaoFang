After upgrading to the latest version (5.6.2.197) my XiaoFang camera didn't work anymore, as it was outside China.

After following the next step my xiaofang is working again. 

- I canceled the camera from the mi home app.
- I put the file (downloaded from the link of the previous post) in a new 32 gb micro sd (fat32)
- After inserting the card in the camera (it has to be off), push and hold the setup button while you plug the camera
- After about 10-15 seconds the light will turn blue
- Stop pressing the setup button and wait for a flashing yellow light
- The firmware is now flashed; you can press for a few seconds the setup button to start the coupling process as usual
##- After that I updated the firmare to the .138 from the mi home app and now it's working flawlessly

The system is still suggesting me to update to .197 but I have been stupid once yet.
Hope this is useful
